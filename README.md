# courseracapstone
The coursera captstone project is the final project for the data science speacialisation. The aim is to build a predictive text model using a large body of data collected from news, blogs and twitter feeds.

Swift key builds a smart keyboard for mobile phones. When someone types "I went to the" on their mobile phone, the keyboard will present 3 options for the next word.

This repository contains
1) A few quiz solutions - a few of the weeks had progress quiz's

2)markdown document of initial exploratory analysis
The report shows summary stats for the data sources, and it is my first attempt at trying to order works and build N-grams

3)Main code.
This is the main R project for building the N-grams that were used for text prediction.

The N grams programs for the shiny app are also available here.
